Based on the eponymous fashion dolls by Mattel, it is the first live-action Barbie film after numerous computer-animated films and specials. The film stars Margot Robbie as the title character and Ryan Gosling as Ken, and follows the pair on a journey of self-discovery following an existential crisis. The supporting cast includes America Ferrera, Kate McKinnon, Issa Rae, Rhea Perlman, and Will Ferrell.\nA live-action Barbie film was announced in September 2009 by Universal Pictures with Laurence Mark producing. Development began in April 2014, when Sony Pictures acquired the film rights. Following multiple writer and director changes and the casting of Amy Schumer and later Anne Hathaway as Barbie, the rights were transferred to Warner Bros. Pictures in October 2018. Robbie was cast in 2019, after Gal Gadot turned down the role due to scheduling conflicts, and Gerwig was announced as director and co-writer with Baumbach in 2020. The rest of the cast was announced in early 2022, with principal photography occurring primarily at Warner Bros. Studios, Leavesden, in England and at the Venice Beach Skatepark in Los Angeles from March to July of that year.\nBarbie premiered at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles on July 9, 2023, and was released in the United States on July 21, by Warner Bros. Pictures. Its simultaneous release with Universal's Oppenheimer led to the Barbenheimer cultural phenomenon, which encouraged audiences to see both films as a double feature. The film received critical acclaim and has grossed $1.43 billion, becoming the highest-grossing film of 2023 as well as the highest-grossing film by a solo female director, the highest-grossing film ever released by Warner Bros., and the 14th highest-grossing film of all time.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nStereotypical Barbie (\"Barbie\") and fellow dolls reside in Barbieland, a matriarchal society populated by different versions of Barbies, Kens, and a group of discontinued models, who are treated like outcasts due to their unconventional traits.

Overnight, she develops bad breath, cellulite, and flat feet, disrupting her usual routines the next day. Weird Barbie, an outcast due to her disfigurement, tells her she must find the child playing with her in the real world to cure her afflictions. Ken stows away in her convertible to join her, to which Barbie reluctantly agrees.\nArriving at Venice Beach, Barbie punches a man for groping her, leading to her and Ken's brief arrest. Alarmed by their presence, Mattel's CEO orders their recapture. Barbie tracks down her owner, a tween girl named Sasha, who criticizes her for encouraging unrealistic beauty standards. Distraught, Barbie discovers that Gloria, a Mattel employee and Sasha's mother, inadvertently catalyzed her existential crisis after Gloria began playing with Sasha's old Barbie toys in a similar state. Mattel attempts to put Barbie in a toy box for remanufacturing, but she escapes with Gloria and Sasha's help and the three travel to Barbieland with Mattel executives in pursuit.\nMeanwhile, Ken learns about the patriarchal system and feels respected for the first time. Returning to Barbieland, he persuades the other Kens to take over, and the Barbies are indoctrinated into submissive roles, such as agreeable girlfriends, housewives, and maids. Barbie arrives and unsuccessfully tries to convince Ken and the other Barbies to return to the way things were. She becomes depressed, but Gloria gives an inspirational speech about society's conflicting expectations of women, which restores Barbie's self-confidence.\nWith the assistance of Sasha, Weird Barbie, Allan, and the discontinued dolls, Gloria's speeches deprogram the Barbies from their indoctrination. The Barbies manipulate the Kens into fighting amongst themselves, distracting them from enshrining male superiority into Barbieland's constitution, and the Barbies regain power.

In April 2014, Mattel teamed with Sony Pictures to produce the film, which would have Jenny Bicks writing the screenplay and Laurie MacDonald and Walter F. Parkes producing through the Parkes+MacDonald Image Nation banner they created. Filming at the time was anticipated to begin by the end of the year. In March 2015, Diablo Cody was brought onto the project to rewrite the screenplay, and Amy Pascal joined the producing team. Sony would again have rewrites done to the screenplay later that year, hiring Lindsey Beer, Bert V. Royal, and Hillary Winston to write separate drafts.In December 2016, Amy Schumer entered negotiations to star in the title role with Winston's screenplay; Schumer helped rewrite the script with her sister, Kim Caramele. In March 2017, Schumer exited negotiations, blaming scheduling conflicts with the planned June 2017 filming start; in 2023 she revealed she left the project due to creative differences with the film's producers at the time.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "76fac28d-3a03-4be1-aa83-cd070cea6806": {"__data__": {"id_": "76fac28d-3a03-4be1-aa83-cd070cea6806", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"title": "Barbie (film)"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6aa5e3b6-b264-411d-867e-67476cc15e77", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "5e740aafdfef80aa296a2312b236eca58eca37456147fafc40f779636a923c46"}, "2": {"node_id": "10d397de-00de-4bac-aebe-97064b8c9e0a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "ad7e2d25f21378d2ad5cd92137d046543280fd30b106c1ea7d82da52a0a284f7"}, "3": {"node_id": "afa53cff-a95d-4eeb-8398-725ed6d1fabe", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "9690fd441e8532ed87c948c415cdabecf391b68805191497b501f1f7be8db861"}}, "hash": "761c46a4962d6d7ce2d86f29a5134422e3d1cc8ad5ae01b8819659ddd3501033", "text": "she revealed she left the project due to creative differences with the film's producers at the time. That July, Anne Hathaway was under consideration for the title role, with Sony hiring Olivia Milch to rewrite the screenplay and approaching Alethea Jones to direct as a means to interest Hathaway into signing on. Jones was attached to direct by March 2018.In August 2018, Robbie Brenner had been hired as producer by Mattel CEO Ynon Kreiz with the rights reverting to Mattel, with Kreiz having the intention to repossess the rights following the expiration of Sony's option. Later, Brenner was hired to run Mattel Films. The expiration of Sony's option on the project in October 2018 and its transfer to Warner Bros. Pictures would see the departures of Hathaway, Jones, Macdonald, Parkes and Pascal. Margot Robbie would enter early talks for the role, with Patty Jenkins briefly considered for the director position. Kreiz was determined to cast Robbie in the titular role after meeting with her following his hiring as CEO as both he and Brenner felt that Robbie's appearance resembled that of a conventional Barbie doll and were impressed by her ideas. Initial meetings occurred at the Polo Lounge located in The Beverly Hills Hotel. Brenner eventually partnered with Robbie's production company, LuckyChap Entertainment, with Robbie's husband Tom Ackerley and Josey McNamara also being enlisted as producers. Robbie's casting was confirmed in July 2019.In her capacity as a producer, Robbie pitched Barbie to Warner Bros. herself. During the green-light meeting, she compared the film to Steven Spielberg's Jurassic Park (1993) and also jokingly suggested that it would gross over $1 billion. Later on, she approached Greta Gerwig\u2014whose previous films, particularly Little Women (2019), Robbie enjoyed\u2014to be the screenwriter. Gerwig was in post-production for another film, and accepted the assignment on the condition that her partner, Noah Baumbach, also write the script. Gerwig would sign on to also direct the film in July 2021. Robbie said the film aimed at subverting expectations and giving audiences \"the thing you didn't know you wanted\". In August 2023, it was announced that Robbie would earn \"roughly $50 million in salary and box office bonuses\" as the star and producer of the film.\n\n\n=== Writing ===\n\nGerwig and Baumbach were given full creative freedom in writing the film.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "afa53cff-a95d-4eeb-8398-725ed6d1fabe": {"__data__": {"id_": "afa53cff-a95d-4eeb-8398-725ed6d1fabe", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"title": "Barbie (film)"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6aa5e3b6-b264-411d-867e-67476cc15e77", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "5e740aafdfef80aa296a2312b236eca58eca37456147fafc40f779636a923c46"}, "2": {"node_id": "76fac28d-3a03-4be1-aa83-cd070cea6806", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "761c46a4962d6d7ce2d86f29a5134422e3d1cc8ad5ae01b8819659ddd3501033"}, "3": {"node_id": "5a7cb4ef-30e0-441c-a422-06ccbe0860f3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "5de7cb90457a61fbe5cfc79561dad267dcdab7ffa3eb29fa2f9d66b21b23ef9e"}}, "hash": "9690fd441e8532ed87c948c415cdabecf391b68805191497b501f1f7be8db861", "text": "Writing ===\n\nGerwig and Baumbach were given full creative freedom in writing the film. They collaborated on the screenplay during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns of 2020\u20132021 and described the writing process as \"open\" and \"free\". Gerwig's film treatment consisted of an Abstract Poem on Barbie influenced by the Apostles' Creed. For the narrative arc, she was partially inspired by the non-fiction book Reviving Ophelia (1994) by Mary Pipher, which accounts the effects of societal pressures on American teenage girls. She also found inspiration in classic Technicolor musicals such as The Red Shoes (1948) and The Umbrellas of Cherbourg (1964), and said: \"They have such a high level of what we came to call authentic artificiality. You have a painted sky in a soundstage. Which is an illusion, but it's also really there. The painted backdrop is really there. The tangibility of the artifice is something that we kept going back to.\" The script also contains candid criticism of Mattel, which created skepticism among Mattel officials when they received the first version. However, Kreiz decided to trust Gerwig. Brenner noted that \"being safe in this world doesn't work\" as she interpreted Barbie to be a \"bold\" and \"trailblazer\" figure. As a result, Will Ferrell's portrayal as the Mattel CEO was meant to be an allegory for corporate America. Kreiz praised Ferrell and said that while Mattel officials took their brands seriously, they did not take themselves seriously. Gerwig and Robbie had both felt the film was \"most certainly a feminist film\" but Mattel officials had rejected the description. Both Gerwig and Robbie informed the studio that they would also explore the controversies and problematic parts of Barbie, but also convinced the studio that they would respect the product.Gerwig was also influenced by her childhood experiences with Barbie; her mother would discourage her from purchasing such dolls, but eventually allowed her to. Opting to acknowledge the controversial nature of the Barbie doll, Gerwig chose to create a film in which she would be both \"doing the thing and subverting the thing\", in the sense that she would be celebrating the feminism behind Barbie while also noting the controversial beauty standards associated with it. She was also fascinated by the idea that humans create dolls, which in turn imitate humans, feeling that \"we're in constant conversation with", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5a7cb4ef-30e0-441c-a422-06ccbe0860f3": {"__data__": {"id_": "5a7cb4ef-30e0-441c-a422-06ccbe0860f3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"title": "Barbie (film)"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6aa5e3b6-b264-411d-867e-67476cc15e77", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "5e740aafdfef80aa296a2312b236eca58eca37456147fafc40f779636a923c46"}, "2": {"node_id": "afa53cff-a95d-4eeb-8398-725ed6d1fabe", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "9690fd441e8532ed87c948c415cdabecf391b68805191497b501f1f7be8db861"}, "3": {"node_id": "e5bbe612-2033-491d-9bcb-bd6b7cdc4587", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "c01adf4864dcde7eb7403933bb9133764069f99246dd9316a90e452781e89da8"}}, "hash": "5de7cb90457a61fbe5cfc79561dad267dcdab7ffa3eb29fa2f9d66b21b23ef9e", "text": "that humans create dolls, which in turn imitate humans, feeling that \"we're in constant conversation with inanimate objects\" while also conveying an affirmative message to the audience to \"just be yourself and know that that's enough\". The film deliberately juxtaposed contradictory messaging, such as critiquing consumerism yet glamorizing plastic products, and in the ending of the film, in which Barbie desires to be more than just a plastic doll. Gerwig made the film as an \"earnest attempt to make amends\" with the intention of affirming the worth of women and conveying the impossibility of perfection, which some perceived to be standards associated with Barbie. Reflecting upon the maximalism of Barbie, Gerwig said the \"ontology of Barbie\" was similar to what she perceived as Shakespeare's maximalism, which she enjoyed in his works. She grounded the film in what she described as a \"heightened theatricality that allows you to deal with big ideas in the midst of anarchic play\".Gerwig described the film as being anarchic, unhinged, and humanist. She felt the film originated from the \"deep isolation of the pandemic\", opining that the line in which Barbie says \"Do you guys ever think about dying?\" exemplifies the film's anarchic nature. She also found the idea of Barbie being \"constrained in multitudes\" as \"all of these women are Barbie and Barbie is all of these women\" to be \"trippy\" and felt as a result, Barbie did not need to have her own personal life, as she was attuned to her environment. She also described the story as mirroring a girl's journey from childhood to adolescence, though she did not deem it to be a coming of age film and felt that the film ultimately \"ends up, really, about being human\".Primarily, she began her writing by interpreting Barbie as living in a utopia and eventually experiencing reality, where she would have to \"confront all the things that were shielded from them in this place [Barbieland]\". She also drew parallels to the story of Adam and Eve and taking inspiration from John Milton's Paradise Lost, particularly being inspired by the concept that there is \"no poetry without pain\".

She also desired to provide a \"counterargument\" to Barbie by featuring a scene in which Barbie learns that some women do not like her, and felt it gave the film \"real intellectual and emotional power\". As such, a scene is featured in which Barbie is being stared at inappropriately on the Venice Beach, which Gerwig chose to feature as she felt it was a universal experience, being especially relevant for actors. She was inspired by an audition she did in which she wore overalls and felt that she did not perform well in. The ending of the film features Barbie saying the line \"I'm here to see my gynecologist\", with Gerwig describing it as a \"mic drop kind of joke\". She had chosen to include the line as she had wanted to instill confidence in younger girls, as she had been embarrassed about her body when she was younger.Barbie also explores the negative consequences of hierarchical power structures, with Gerwig saying that she extrapolated that \"Barbies rule and Kens are an underclass\" and felt it was similar to the Planet of the Apes. Ken has low self-esteem and seeks approval from Barbie, which Gerwig identified as a good source for a story. Gosling compared Gerwig's vision to Milton Glaser's I Love New York logo as he felt Gerwig created the film's characters as a way of understanding the contemporary world. Ken has the only power ballad in the film, and Gerwig had identified it as the moment in which she felt the film transcended what a Barbie movie traditionally should have been.\n\n\n=== Casting ===\nDuring the casting process, Gerwig and Robbie searched for actresses with \"Barbie energy\" (which they described as \"a certain ineffable combination of beauty and exuberance\"). In October 2021, Ryan Gosling entered final negotiations to play Ken in the film. America Ferrera, Simu Liu and Kate McKinnon were cast in February 2022.

In April 2023, a trailer revealed that John Cena had joined the cast. It was later reported that Cena had spontaneously been offered a part in the film after paying for Robbie's meal in London during production. Helen Mirren narrated the film's trailer and the film itself. Robbie and Gosling were each paid $12.5 million for their participation as actors.Robbie wanted Gal Gadot to play a Barbie in the film, but Gadot was unavailable due to scheduling conflicts. Gerwig wanted her frequent collaborators Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet and Saoirse Ronan to make cameo appearances, but neither was available, Gerwig revealed that during a visit to the set, Chalamet said he should have been in the film. Additionally, Bowen Yang, Dan Levy and Ben Platt were considered for Ken; Jonathan Groff was the first choice for Allan but turned it down.\n\n\n=== Set design ===\nSarah Greenwood and Katie Spencer serve as set designer and decorator, respectively, on the film. For the Barbie Dreamhouse, the pair drew inspiration from the mid-century modernist architecture found in Palm Springs, including the Kaufmann Desert House by Richard Neutra, as well as the photography of Slim Aarons. Gerwig wanted to capture \"what was so ridiculously fun about the Dreamhouses\", alluding to its previous models, and referenced Pee-wee's Big Adventure (1985), the paintings of Wayne Thiebaud, and the apartment of Gene Kelly's character in the Technicolor musical An American in Paris (1951). \"Everything needed to be tactile, because toys are, above all, things you touch\", Gerwig was quoted saying of the use of practical effects instead of CGI to capture the sky and the San Jacinto Mountains. The set design is also noted for its extensive use of a specific shade of pink paint, Pantone 219.

She also sought to use practical builds and had to first film sequences in miniature models and then composite the footage onto the actual image. She had already discussed the production design with cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto, Greenwood, and costume designer Jacqueline Duran a year beforehand to prepare for the film. Gerwig also called the director Peter Weir for inspiration on Barbie Land, with the idea of creating it as an \"interior soundstage world\".\n\n\n=== Costumes ===\nCostume designer Jacqueline Durran, who previously collaborated with Gerwig on Little Women (2019), employed a practical approach to create Barbie's wardrobe: \"The defining characteristic of what she wears is where she's going and what she's doing, [i]t's about being completely dressed for your job or task.\" To match the film's Barbieland setting, Durran and her team created costumes made of roughly fifteen color combinations \"that riffed off the idea of a French Riviera beach in the early 1960s\" and drew inspiration from actress Brigitte Bardot. For Ken's outfits, Durran zeroed in a look composed of colorful sportswear from the 1980s, while actor Ryan Gosling suggested a Ken-branded underwear for the character. Durran closely adapted outfits from past iterations of Barbie dolls, such as the 1993 \"Western Stampin'\" dolls and the 1994 \"Hot Skatin'\" dolls. She noted the Barbie dolls as \"a very useful way to look at different ideas of femininity: what that means, who owns it, and who it's aimed at\" and reflected this idea in how she dressed the characters. While the majority of the clothing featured in the film were sourced by Durran and her team, they also pulled pieces from the fashion archives of Chanel.\n\n\n=== Filming ===\nPrincipal photography began on March 22, 2022, at Warner Bros. Studios, Leavesden in England and wrapped on July 21, 2022. Among the notable filming locations was the Venice Beach Skatepark in Los Angeles, California. Rodrigo Prieto served as cinematographer. Prior to filming, Gerwig had organized a sleepover with the female cast members for them to establish positive relationships while also feeling that it \"would be the most fun way to kick everything off\". She also opted to use filming techniques from the 1950s, as", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fe11d92d-71f5-458f-af7b-139b1f868279": {"__data__": {"id_": "fe11d92d-71f5-458f-af7b-139b1f868279", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"title": "Barbie (film)"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6aa5e3b6-b264-411d-867e-67476cc15e77", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "5e740aafdfef80aa296a2312b236eca58eca37456147fafc40f779636a923c46"}, "2": {"node_id": "e64202b2-b8db-42c4-811b-0aa787314596", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "7bd8b5fc382a4344a0d6a2fcd7258bba4159670cb020f1c5e9c56fc14f50c01f"}, "3": {"node_id": "f7e84121-92a2-41d9-a90d-46dcfd4c3766", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "74d284593aaa9b30d155cc8cd2b76e8abe67a0a48ec1db724722771616215d18"}}, "hash": "318db555c8356a45e99aa70cc14e0510d381b1a5b82b6be2cee803e74cf57666", "text": "fun way to kick everything off\". She also opted to use filming techniques from the 1950s, as Barbie has been a popular toy since 1959, with the intention of recreating a period-accurate look. Additionally, she watched Powell and Pressburger's A Matter of Life and Death (1946) to understand how older visual effects were used to provide a sense of theatricality. To highlight the tragic nature of Barbie and Ken facing the difficulties of the real world, she directed Robbie and Gosling to play their characters as if they were in a drama. Reshoots took place in Los Angeles in April 2023.\n\n\n=== Hair and makeup ===\nIvana Primorac was the lead hair and makeup artist for the film.\n\n\n== Music ==\n\nAlexandre Desplat, who collaborated with Gerwig on Little Women (2019), was set to score Barbie in early September 2022. However, by May 2023, Desplat had left the project, with Mark Ronson and Andrew Wyatt taking over scoring duties. The score was released by WaterTower Music on August 4, 2023.In addition to the score, Ronson was tasked with curating a compilation soundtrack that matched Gerwig's vision for Barbie. As the film was being edited in post-production, Ronson and Gerwig would show scenes from the film to artists they wanted on the soundtrack. The film's soundtrack, Barbie: The Album, was released on July 21, 2023. The album features songs by artists Ava Max, Charli XCX, Dominic Fike, Fifty Fifty, Gayle, Haim, Ice Spice, Kali, Karol G, Khalid, Sam Smith, Lizzo, Nicki Minaj, Billie Eilish, Pink Pantheress, Tame Impala, the Kid Laroi, and cast members Ryan Gosling and Dua Lipa. \"Dance the Night\" by Dua Lipa was released as the album's lead single on May 26, 2023. It was followed by \"Watati\" by Karol G on June 2, 2023. \"Angel\" by Pink Pantheress was released on June 9, 2023, as the first promotional single. \"Barbie World\" by Nicki Minaj and Ice Spice was released as the album's third single on June 23, 2023.

On July 10, 2023, Warner Bros. released a preview clip of Ryan Gosling singing \"I'm Just Ken\". The album's fourth single, \"What Was I Made For?\" by Billie Eilish, was released on July 13, 2023.Despite fan expectations for the 1997 song \"Barbie Girl\" by the pop band Aqua to feature in the film, Ulrich M\u00f8ller-J\u00f8rgensen, manager for Aqua lead singer Lene Nystr\u00f8m, said that it was not used, while Variety speculated that this was due to bad relations between Mattel and MCA Records, the song's American publisher, who engaged in a series of lawsuits over the song from 1997 to 2002. \"Barbie World\", a rework of the song, was instead featured in the film. It samples \"Barbie Girl\"; Aqua is credited as a performer and co-writer on the track.The film features multiple renditions of the 1989 song \"Closer to Fine\" by the Indigo Girls and the 1997 song \"Push\" by Matchbox Twenty, the latter of which Ken adopts as his favorite song after visiting the real world, which becomes \"a tongue-in-cheek anthem of patriarchal dominance\" in the fictional Barbieland. While many reviews of the film interpreted this as a critique of the song, director Greta Gerwig said that she was a fan of Matchbox Twenty and \"I never put anything in a movie I don't love.\" \"Spice Up Your Life\" by Spice Girls plays in a flashback scene where Sasha destroys her mother's Barbies. Cyndi Lauper's \"Girls Just Want to Have Fun\" plays when Barbie is about to leave her Dreamhouse and head to the real world.\n\n\n== Marketing ==\nBarbie was promoted with an extensive marketing campaign. In the months leading up to the release of the film, Mattel entered into several Barbie-themed promotional partnerships and collaborations with various brands, including Airbnb, Aldo, Bloomingdale's, Burger King Brazil, Chi Haircare, Forever 21, Gap, Hot Topic, Krispy Kreme Philippines, Primark, Progressive", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "05a4535b-7f5e-418a-ae1b-8532a85b1e4d": {"__data__": {"id_": "05a4535b-7f5e-418a-ae1b-8532a85b1e4d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"title": "Barbie (film)"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6aa5e3b6-b264-411d-867e-67476cc15e77", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "5e740aafdfef80aa296a2312b236eca58eca37456147fafc40f779636a923c46"}, "2": {"node_id": "f7e84121-92a2-41d9-a90d-46dcfd4c3766", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "74d284593aaa9b30d155cc8cd2b76e8abe67a0a48ec1db724722771616215d18"}, "3": {"node_id": "45cfe122-58c2-42b3-8f3b-6dd2c421f078", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "c34ae25970e3a9c9aae73f4b7da6b4659e9b174fd3a7942fd0ffac863f071c26"}}, "hash": "4257d59e40a36adf4d5d240ab218109ffca8b14074a02ec36e0b74473a56ff49", "text": "Forever 21, Gap, Hot Topic, Krispy Kreme Philippines, Primark, Progressive Insurance, Spirit Halloween, Ulta, and Xbox. Additionally, studio parent company Warner Bros. Discovery engaged in cross-promotion for the film through its TV channels, most prominently with an HGTV renovation reality competition series titled Barbie Dreamhouse Challenge, coproduced by Mattel Television, which premiered shortly before the film's release. Trade publication Variety reported that Warner Bros. spent $150 million on marketing for Barbie\u2014more than the $145 million budget used to produce the movie itself.A first-look image of the film was revealed during a Warner Bros. presentation at CinemaCon in April 2022. Released to the public on April 27, 2022, the image saw Margot Robbie as Barbie, sitting behind the wheel of her iconic pink 1956 Chevrolet Corvette. Collider complimented Robbie in the image, stating: \"This photo is just further proof that Robbie was made to play this role. She just looks like a Barbie doll come to life\u2014it's almost uncanny\". On June 15, 2022, a second still featuring Ryan Gosling as Ken was released. Despite noting similarities between his look in the image and his previous roles, The Guardian asserted that \"there is a very strong chance that this will be [Gosling's] defining role\".A booth dedicated to Barbie was opened at the 2022 CCXP event in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. The first teaser trailer for the film debuted during preview screenings of Avatar: The Way of Water in December 2022. It featured a parody of the opening \"Dawn of Man\" sequence in Stanley Kubrick's 1968 film 2001: A Space Odyssey, in which Robbie (clad in Barbie's original 1959 outfit) imitates an alien monolith whose influence on the history of dolls is narrated by Mirren. Along with a theatrical poster, the teaser trailer was released to the public on December 16, 2022. Rolling Stone praised the 2001 homage and vibrant colors of the trailer, and remarked on its vague outlining of the plot: \"One has to wonder when, or better yet how, it will all get shaken up\".On April 4, 2023, twenty-four character posters of the several Barbies and Kens featured in the film\u2014each tagged with brief descriptions\u2014were shared on the Barbie's social media accounts.

A second teaser trailer was unveiled shortly after the release of the posters. It featured a rendition of the Beach Boys' 1964 surf rock song \"Fun, Fun, Fun\". The Washington Post noted that the \"visually striking\" and \"polysemic\" teaser captivated multiple demographics because of its humor, color palette, and the Barbie doll's cross-generational appeal. An official trailer for the film was released on May 25, 2023. Critics noted for its existential tone set against upbeat music. Ben Travis of Empire said: \"There's much to discuss here\u2014not least, that it looks visually impeccable\" and speculated Academy Awards attention for its production and costume design.A parade float was featured at the 2023 WeHo Pride Parade in Los Angeles to promote the film. Two of its LGBTQ+ cast members, Alexandra Shipp and Scott Evans, were present during the event.In June 2023, a French Barbie poster went viral for including the tagline \"Elle peut tout faire. Lui, c'est juste Ken.\", which literally translates to \"She can do everything. He's just Ken.\" However, ken is the verlan slang term for \"fuck\" in French, i.e. the phonological inversion of nique, while c'est (\"he is\") is a homophone for sait (\"he knows how\"), meaning the tagline could be read as \"She can do everything. He just knows how to fuck.\" Analysts concluded that it was likely that the pun was intentional, as the slang term is common knowledge among French speakers, though Warner Bros. would neither confirm nor deny whether this was the case.\nLeading up to the release, pink billboards, blank apart from the film's release date, have appeared worldwide, and a real-world \"Barbie Dreamhouse\" in Malibu, California became available to rent through Airbnb.On July 14, 2023, SAG-AFTRA, an American labor union of film, television, and voice actors, declared a strike action, effectively halting any promotional event that involves any member in the guild.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2df3b7ef-2b3f-416b-a4fc-895b91481d27": {"__data__": {"id_": "2df3b7ef-2b3f-416b-a4fc-895b91481d27", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"title": "Barbie (film)"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6aa5e3b6-b264-411d-867e-67476cc15e77", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "5e740aafdfef80aa296a2312b236eca58eca37456147fafc40f779636a923c46"}, "2": {"node_id": "45cfe122-58c2-42b3-8f3b-6dd2c421f078", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "c34ae25970e3a9c9aae73f4b7da6b4659e9b174fd3a7942fd0ffac863f071c26"}, "3": {"node_id": "960feea3-4bb9-46ae-ac87-f6b37525916d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "f92ba2b979b17ef76fed750f0018db2058cbc0555596086a36d8a0a01f003328"}}, "hash": "28b13fdebc514f9b814c5fa41324693c5bbc58a249d76b2edffb74212e3e4cce", "text": "actors, declared a strike action, effectively halting any promotional event that involves any member in the guild.

It was released theatrically in the United States and the United Kingdom on July 21, 2023, taking over the original release date of Coyote vs. Acme. Previous iterations of the project were set for June 2, 2017; May 12, 2017; June 29, 2018; August 8, 2018; and May 8, 2020.The film was released on the same day as Oppenheimer, a biographical film about J. Robert Oppenheimer written and directed by Christopher Nolan based on the book American Prometheus, and distributed by Universal Pictures. Due to the tonal and genre contrast between the two films, many social media users created memes and ironic posts about how the two films appealed to different audiences, and how they should be viewed as a double feature. The trend was dubbed \"Barbenheimer\". In an interview with La Vanguardia, Oppenheimer star Cillian Murphy endorsed the phenomenon, saying, \"My advice would be for people to go see both, on the same day. If they are good films, then that's cinema's gain.\"In August 2023, it was announced that the film will be re-released in IMAX theaters on September 22, 2023, for one week only, along with a new post-credit scene. The IMAX edition starts with an onscreen introduction by Greta Gerwig, who notes the advantages of the IMAX format.

Home Entertainment.\n\n\n=== Censorship ===\n\n\n==== Nine-dash line controversy ====\n\nThe controversy over the alleged appearance of the nine-dash line (a depiction of the South China Sea from Chinese perspective) in the film began when Vietnam's film censorship authority banned the film for allegedly displaying such lines. In contrast, the Philippine counterpart instead requested that the lines in question be blurred. Both countries have banned the films Abominable (2019) and Uncharted (2022) for featuring the actual nine-dash line. The nine-dash line is controversial due to maritime border disputes between China, Vietnam, Taiwan, Malaysia, Brunei, and the Philippines.\n\n\n==== Vietnam ====\nOn July 3, 2023, Vietnamese newspaper Tu\u1ed5i Tr\u1ebb quoted Vi Ki\u1ebfn Th\u00e0nh, head of the Department of Cinema, as announcing that Barbie would be banned in Vietnam because it contained \"the offending image of the nine-dash line.\" The Ti\u1ec1n Phong newspaper reported that the nine-dash line \"appears multiple times in the film\". The film was originally scheduled to be released in Vietnam on July 21.Speaking to Voice of America, Tr\u1ecbnh H\u1eefu Long (founder of the research group Legal Initiatives for Vietnam) said, \"The censors will even be praised for overreacting to the unclear map, by both their superiors and the public, because anti-China sentiment runs deep into the country's political culture\", and that \"the government is surely using legitimate nationalist reasoning to strengthen its entire censorship system\", while Michael Caster at the free expression group Article 19 said, \"Maps are political, and borders often bear historical wounds, but rather than ensuring free and open discussion, the knee jerk response to censor seldom supports historical or", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fc9e4453-1eec-4a34-81dc-4234fcb5d74b": {"__data__": {"id_": "fc9e4453-1eec-4a34-81dc-4234fcb5d74b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"title": "Barbie (film)"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6aa5e3b6-b264-411d-867e-67476cc15e77", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "5e740aafdfef80aa296a2312b236eca58eca37456147fafc40f779636a923c46"}, "2": {"node_id": "960feea3-4bb9-46ae-ac87-f6b37525916d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "f92ba2b979b17ef76fed750f0018db2058cbc0555596086a36d8a0a01f003328"}, "3": {"node_id": "df4eac90-1860-4db4-89de-7105f52c89fa", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2d830088f4931e181bdd887d0993d6dc6ad283d0c567f2468ca3d204e2d4a3fb"}}, "hash": "0e05e9011443d0a9664c7b65fb435a02fb0d579ffe6afb363531e89fbe2afea9", "text": "but rather than ensuring free and open discussion, the knee jerk response to censor seldom supports historical or transitional justice\".Speaking to Vox, UC Berkeley professor Peter Zinoman said, \"To the Chinese, the nine-dash line signifies their legitimate claims to the South China Sea\", and \"to the Vietnamese, it symbolizes a brazen act of imperialist bullying that elevates Chinese national interest over an older shared set of interests of socialist brotherhood,\" while Harvard University professor Hu\u1ec7-T\u00e2m H\u1ed3 T\u00e0i said since the producers of the film were aiming for the mainland Chinese market in the hopes that it would be a blockbuster, \"they are ready to accept [mainland China's] view of geography. Disinformation works by repetition.\" New York University professor Kevin Li said, \"In my view, banning [Barbie] was a no-brainer.\"In response to Vietnam's ban, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning stated at a press briefing on July 4 that the \"South China Sea issue\" should not be linked with \"normal cultural exchange\".\n\n\n==== The Philippines ====\nWhen news of Vietnam's ban reached the Philippines, Senator Francis Tolentino, vice chairman of the Philippine Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, told CNN Philippines that Barbie may also be banned in the country because it \"denigrates\" Filipino sovereignty. Senator Jinggoy Estrada called the film to be banned over the alleged inclusion of the nine-dash line; opposition senator Risa Hontiveros quipped \"the movie is fiction, and so is the nine-dash line\", and suggested adding a disclaimer to the film instead of banning its release. Senator Robin Padilla, chairman of the Senate mass media committee, suggested that the film producers must edit out references to the nine-dash line or risk the film being banned.On July 11, the Philippines' Movie and Television Review and Classification Board (MTRCB) came to the conclusion that there was \"no basis\" to banning the film as the map was simply \"cartoonish\" and that there was no clear nor outright depiction of the nine-dash line, as the line in the film was \"not U-Shaped\" and had \"eight dots or dashes\" instead of nine. The board gave the film a PG rating, as well as allowing it to be screened in the country, however they requested Warner Bros. to \"blur the controversial lines in order to avoid further", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "df4eac90-1860-4db4-89de-7105f52c89fa": {"__data__": {"id_": "df4eac90-1860-4db4-89de-7105f52c89fa", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"title": "Barbie (film)"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6aa5e3b6-b264-411d-867e-67476cc15e77", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "5e740aafdfef80aa296a2312b236eca58eca37456147fafc40f779636a923c46"}, "2": {"node_id": "fc9e4453-1eec-4a34-81dc-4234fcb5d74b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "0e05e9011443d0a9664c7b65fb435a02fb0d579ffe6afb363531e89fbe2afea9"}, "3": {"node_id": "587a04dd-3643-4274-8263-c5dfa53a9c27", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "7f42742ecad8ab9ded4b19a71d542266ca3d2e57af17108844b86fa7c10e94b4"}}, "hash": "2d830088f4931e181bdd887d0993d6dc6ad283d0c567f2468ca3d204e2d4a3fb", "text": "country, however they requested Warner Bros. to \"blur the controversial lines in order to avoid further misinterpretations\". Senator Tolentino said that he respected the MTRCB's decision, but expressed his dismay at it emerging a day before the seventh anniversary of Philippines' victory in an arbitration over the nine-dash line on July 12, 2016. The film was released in the Philippines on July 19, 2023.\n\n\n==== World map drawing and Warner Bros.' statement ====\nWith the rising concerns over the alleged appearance of the nine-dash line, several media outlets pointed to a drawing of a world map which appears in a trailer for the film. The Los Angeles Times described the particular image as a \"map of 'the real world' [which] looks as if it's been drawn in crayon by a child\" with a line of dashes \"alongside the coast of what should be China.\" On July 6, 2023, Warner Bros. issued a statement explaining that the map in the concerned image is a \"child-like crayon drawing\", with the dashed lines depicting Barbie's journey from Barbie Land to the real world and was \"not intended to make any type of statement\". Jordan Richard Schoenherr from Concordia University said that while the map might seem innocuous, the repeated presentation of images that supported the goals of the Chinese government risks increasing their acceptance by international publics and is therefore a cause for concern. In the world map drawing, dashed lines can be seen near Asia, the United States, Greenland, Brazil and Africa.\n\n\n==== Religious interpretation and LGBTQ+ themes ====\nIn some Muslim-majority countries, there were attempts to ban the film on moral grounds or for allegedly showing LGBTQ+ themes, and some of them were successful.\n\n\n==== Pakistan ====\nIn Pakistan, the film was released nationwide on July 21, 2023. The Punjab Film Censor Board (which handles the censorship in the Punjab province) and other regional equivalents cleared the film for screening. But on July 22, Punjab province's caretaker Minister of Information and Culture Amir Mir used his authority to halt the screenings of the film in the province, alleging that it \"[shows] homosexuality.\" Punjab's Information Secretary Ali Nawaz Malik told Dawn that the film \"has been sent to Dubai for a censorship review.\" On August 1, the final approval was given for the film to be shown in the province.\n\n\n==== Middle East", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "587a04dd-3643-4274-8263-c5dfa53a9c27": {"__data__": {"id_": "587a04dd-3643-4274-8263-c5dfa53a9c27", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"title": "Barbie (film)"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6aa5e3b6-b264-411d-867e-67476cc15e77", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "5e740aafdfef80aa296a2312b236eca58eca37456147fafc40f779636a923c46"}, "2": {"node_id": "df4eac90-1860-4db4-89de-7105f52c89fa", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2d830088f4931e181bdd887d0993d6dc6ad283d0c567f2468ca3d204e2d4a3fb"}, "3": {"node_id": "d30d50d4-1d85-46e2-bada-aef49f6dfe8e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "21c1ed52ea48c268a7f843125740a8c8f6e25fbf3886e665be4db41f7b747fcb"}}, "hash": "7f42742ecad8ab9ded4b19a71d542266ca3d2e57af17108844b86fa7c10e94b4", "text": "the final approval was given for the film to be shown in the province.\n\n\n==== Middle East ====\nIn the Middle East, the film was initially scheduled to be released on July 19, 2023, before being delayed to August 31. Later, Vox Cinemas, the distributor of Warner Bros. films in the region, announced that the film would be released in the region on August 10. Although the film censorship authorities in the region initially did not specify any reason, it was suggested that the inclusion of a transgender actress in one of Barbie roles, and the narrations and dialogs related to LGBTQ+ matters might have been the issues with the film.On August 9, 2023, Lebanon's Minister of Culture Mohammad Mortada, who is backed by Hezbollah, proposed that the film be banned in the country for \"[promoting] homosexuality and sexual transformation\" and \"[contradicting] values of faith and morality\" by \"diminishing the importance of the family unit\". Following Mortada's proposal, the Minister of Interior and Municipalities Bassam Mawlawi asked the relevant authority (which is under the scope of Interior Ministry's General Security) to review the film and give its recommendation. On August 11, it was reported that the Lebanese authority, comprising the representatives from the General Security and the Ministry of Economy and Trade, found no reason to ban the film in the country. On September 1, the film was formally approved for screening in Lebanon for audiences aged 13 and above. Barbie was released in Lebanese theaters on September 7.Also on August 9, 2023, the Kuwaiti authority formally announced the ban of both Barbie and Australian horror film Talk to Me (which stars a transgender actor), with the head of the authority Lafi Al-Subaie accusing the former of \"carrying ideas that encourage unacceptable behavior and distort society's values.\"\n\n\n==== Algeria ====\nOn August 13, 2023, just three weeks after its release on July 19, the screenings of Barbie were halted in film theaters in Algeria. According to Reuters, the official source was quoted as saying that the film \"promotes homosexuality and other Western deviances\" and that it \"does not comply with Algeria's religious and cultural beliefs.\"\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\n\n=== Box office ===\nAs of October 3, 2023, Barbie has grossed $633.3 million in the United States and Canada, and $800.9 million in other territories,", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d30d50d4-1d85-46e2-bada-aef49f6dfe8e": {"__data__": {"id_": "d30d50d4-1d85-46e2-bada-aef49f6dfe8e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"title": "Barbie (film)"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6aa5e3b6-b264-411d-867e-67476cc15e77", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "5e740aafdfef80aa296a2312b236eca58eca37456147fafc40f779636a923c46"}, "2": {"node_id": "587a04dd-3643-4274-8263-c5dfa53a9c27", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "7f42742ecad8ab9ded4b19a71d542266ca3d2e57af17108844b86fa7c10e94b4"}, "3": {"node_id": "9bc7b14c-7d0a-4181-8305-5c80546b0835", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "ae0338793fb0dcf02257594de1656c96a4de0a57f33ed1ab4dd04473a8b63dfc"}}, "hash": "21c1ed52ea48c268a7f843125740a8c8f6e25fbf3886e665be4db41f7b747fcb", "text": "million in the United States and Canada, and $800.9 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $1.434 billion.It was described as a \"record-breaking\" box office success during its opening weekend, and set the record for any film that was not a sequel, remake, or superhero property. Barbie became the highest-grossing live-action comedy film of all time, smashing the domestic record formerly held by Home Alone (1990) and the worldwide record formerly held by The Hangover Part II (2011) simultaneously. It also become Gerwig's highest-grossing film, overtaking its predecessor Little Women (2019). The film crossed the $1 billion mark worldwide on August 6, 2023, making it the first film by a solo female director to do so. This was also the fastest Warner Bros. film to reach $1 billion, beating Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 2 (2011).

Film critic Youn Sung-Eun told Yonhap News Agency that 'in [South] Korea, where the recognition of feminism is not good, [people] don't want to accept that an amusement like film has a message [about social issues]', and that 'the film uses its later half to preach [about sexual discrimination], which might be hard to accept [to South Koreans]'. In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Kang Hye-jung, the producer of Smugglers, said \"I couldn't understand why Hollywood went so wild about Barbie, perhaps because it has never been our [toy].\"In Japan, Barbie ranked at no. 16. Prior to the release date, public opinion of Barbie had soured after the official Twitter account for the Barbie film had responded positively to several Barbenheimer memes, all of which depicted atomic bombings comically. This was seen as an endorsement of such jokes, and, in turn, was met with disapproval from the Japanese public, who criticized their ignorance, particularly due to their negligence towards the history of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Mitsuki Takahata, who provided Barbie's voice in the Japanese dub of the film, stated on her Instagram account that she was disappointed and had considered dropping out of one of the film's promotional events.\n\n\n=== Critical response ===\nBarbie attained critical acclaim. According to The New York Times, critics praised the script for addressing past criticisms of the Barbie brand's portrayal of women and lack of diversity while infusing humor, but there were also critics who felt that it did not go far enough in critiquing consumerism and beauty standards. The performances of Robbie and Gosling received widespread acclaim.On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 88% of 472 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 7.9/10. The website's consensus reads: \"Barbie is a visually dazzling comedy whose meta humor is smartly complemented by subversive storytelling.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 80 out of 100, based on 67 critics, indicating \"generally favorable\" reviews. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale, while those polled at PostTrak gave it an 89%", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "82c51cad-f109-4e02-8358-234ef7641cba": {"__data__": {"id_": "82c51cad-f109-4e02-8358-234ef7641cba", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"title": "Barbie (film)"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6aa5e3b6-b264-411d-867e-67476cc15e77", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "5e740aafdfef80aa296a2312b236eca58eca37456147fafc40f779636a923c46"}, "2": {"node_id": "a61d4cb2-baab-43f8-8855-663f7e9cc2e6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2aa63a851dd5c14f1fe94b6a9e4a8348eb46fe0f97950d17a09ca3ddda300372"}, "3": {"node_id": "7142bc6f-9d62-425a-b142-14ddc6d10426", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "6d4f3691c930c04aa0b92000d57a7edaac1c1fd2aff29601716e42318ced0b02"}}, "hash": "1d8eb59cb09916f65d6c9265bff527ef83103e810328ba2df77869e6ed51b1fe", "text": "on an A+ to F scale, while those polled at PostTrak gave it an 89% overall positive score, with 79% saying they would definitely recommend the film.In his review for the Chicago Tribune, Michael Phillips called Barbie \"a lovely, eccentrically imaginative example of brand extension and raw, untrammeled commercialism\", applauded the production design, and summed: \"The crucial partnership here is the one between director and performer, Gerwig and Robbie; anything Gerwig and Baumbach's verbally dexterous script requires, from Barbie's first teardrop to the final punchline, Robbie handles with unerring precision\". Richard Brody of The New Yorker called it \"brilliant, beautiful and fun as hell\", claiming the \"giddily stylized vision of a doll coming to life makes a serious case for the art of adapting even the most sanitized I.P.\" and commended the \"free and wild\" direction as well as the \"profuse and exquisite\" visual aesthetics. Charlotte O'Sullivan of the Evening Standard hailed the film as \"easily the comedy of the year\" with a large amount of fun, where \"star and producer Margot Robbie, and writer-director Greta Gerwig, have done themselves proud\" with a \"breezily outrageous\" film \"about a woman\u2019s right to be 'weird, dark and crazy'.\" Eileen Jones of Jacobin said that the film \"manages to overcome cumbersome plotting and feminist pieties to provide a delightful spectacle of funny moments that add up to something pretty good.\" In The Guardian, Peter Bradshaw awarded Barbie a 3 out of 5 stars, describing it as \"beamingly affectionate and deliriously pink-themed\" but \"perhaps a giant two-hour commercial for a product\" and highlighted Gosling as a scene-stealer, being given \"all the best lines\". In India Currents, Amann Mahajan notes, \"Perhaps the most impactful ... moment[] is one in which Barbie is calmly eviscerated by a teenage girl who dubs her a 'fascist.'

Variety critic Peter Debruge praised the humor for giving \"permission to challenge what Barbie represents\" and lauded Gosling's physical performance, but concluded that the film is \"an intellectual experience, not an emotional one, grounded largely in audience nostalgia.\" In the Vulture component of New York, Alison Willmore commended the lead performances, particularly that of Robbie, whom she characterized \"as capable of heartbreaking earnestness as humor, and who sometimes effortlessly achieved both at once\", but lamented the themes of the film, opining that it \"doesn't ultimately want to do much more than talk itself in circles about these themes\". On a similar note, Stephanie Zacharek of Time praised Robbie's \"buoyant, charming performance\", Gosling's \"go-for-broke\" effort, and the \"inventive production design\", but criticized the \"self aware\" nature of the film especially following the first half-hour, concluding that it is a feminist film \"only in the most scattershot way\", and that it's not \"subversive\". Camilla Long of The Times wrote that the film featured Mattel's \"pink, squealing, corporate grasping\", trying to be \"ahead of the sexism curve\", but \"ended up feeling sexist itself\" for its portrayal that \"men are stupid, go to the gym, run everything and don't care about women, while women are sensible, striving but ultimately conflicted victims.\" In the review of Kyle Smith of The Wall Street Journal, he stated: \"As bubbly as the film appears, its script is like a grumpier-than-average women's studies seminar\", exemplified by the Mattel employee character's \"long monologue on how miserable it is to be female\". MovieWeb ranked it number 1 on its list of the \"Best Comedy Movies of the 2020s (So Far),\" writing that \"Gerwig's ode to the Barbie girl and her Barbie world ... is as surprisingly modern and introspective as audiences have come to expect from her work.

It won Most Anticipated Film at the 6th Hollywood Critics Association Midseason Film Awards.\n\n\n== Themes and analysis ==\nAs with the doll itself, feminism and related themes in the film were the subject of discussion. Some reviews for the film saw it as a satire that pokes fun at capitalism, while others perceived it as a satire that cleverly uses capitalist themes.\n\n\n=== Philosophy ===\nBarbie has been characterized as exploring themes of existentialism. Lucy Ford of GQ wrote that the film \"ruminates on the very idea of what makes us human, the idea of 'the other', whether there's truly such a thing as autonomy or if we're all simply pawns to be picked up and disposed of when we are no longer useful\". Ford observed that, in the film, Barbie and Ken go on \"opposite but equal\" journeys of self-discovery, after venturing out into the Real World and learning that it is an oppressive patriarchal society as opposed to the matriarchal utopia that is Barbieland, and get \"caught in the crosshairs of being both sentient and someone else's idea, battling with free will and the omnipresent predetermined rules about where to go and how to act\".In Vogue India, Varya Srivastava applied Beauvoirian concepts of existentialism and individualism to Barbie, arguing that \"individualism makes you question societal norms and expectations [...] Even for Barbie, this has been brewing for a while. She has tried to be inclusive and representative. She has tried to acknowledge the feminist critique and now has jobs like being the President, a scientist, and a doctor.

Existentialism thrives in that gap between what is and what ought to be\". Clark University professor of philosophy Wiebke Deimling compared a scene in the film, in which Barbie has to make a choice between going back to her perfect life in Barbieland or learning the truth about her existence in the Real World, to the experience machine, a thought experiment by American philosopher Robert Nozick. Diemling also observed that gender in Barbieland is performative, noting how the Kens behave before and after a patriarchy is established.Alissa Wilkinson of Vox compared Barbie land to the biblical Garden of Eden, with Barbie and Ken as inverted parallels of Adam and Eve. She saw Barbie and Ken's first impression \"that they're suddenly self-conscious and aware of being looked at\" in the Real World as the film's version of the Fall. Chinese film critic Li Jingfei (\u674e\u7ade\u83f2) compared Barbie's sudden awareness of death to the moment when Siddh\u0101rtha Gautama left the palace of his birth and first learned of suffering and death, which eventually led to his enlightenment.\n\n\n=== Feminism ===\nKatie Pickles of The Conversation said that Barbie shows how the matriarchy can be \"as bad\" as the patriarchy, with the Kens being the objectified and excluded sex in Barbieland. Pickles further comments that the true heroes were outcasts such as Weird Barbie and Allan, who deprogrammed the Barbies from tolerating the status quo. She believes that this aligns with Gerwig's conception of feminism, where \"everyone stands in the sunshine\".Jack Butler of National Review rejected the perception of the film as a \"shallow, man-hating, and repulsive screed\" and argued that the film is instead a \"post-feminist satire of what feminists imagine a perfect world looking like and of what they imagine male dominance is like\", noted that in the Real World, \"Ken is rebuffed in all of his attempts to join the male hierarchy that purportedly dominates the world. He must return to Barbie land to institute it; what he institutes there is so shallow that it collapses almost as quickly as it is set up. Meanwhile, though Robbie's Barbie restores female dominance in Barbieland, she chooses not to stay there, electing instead to become fully human\".Many journalists coupled Barbie with the Eras Tour by Taylor", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f0301c4f-efb2-4f37-b2b8-3d8f163582be": {"__data__": {"id_": "f0301c4f-efb2-4f37-b2b8-3d8f163582be", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"title": "Barbie (film)"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6aa5e3b6-b264-411d-867e-67476cc15e77", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "5e740aafdfef80aa296a2312b236eca58eca37456147fafc40f779636a923c46"}, "2": {"node_id": "c8831367-1a14-4a36-990c-74591b3ce3c4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "557142f59f42a3bbea9d093372ccb866389e225e5f1e2d5d3654a053fbe59d39"}, "3": {"node_id": "e6bf585f-81ac-44df-9d8b-2e720bb41df2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "642994952c58351f81e095cf550d903e529613fa79301e704e7662969cda9901"}}, "hash": "3bab68cab7dccebff29cd9419bf3a91d7d28dd26e054645abfb23bb1423774c5", "text": "there, electing instead to become fully human\".Many journalists coupled Barbie with the Eras Tour by Taylor Swift for the concurrent representation of recontextualized mainstream femininity. Michelle Goldberg of The New York Times described the launch of the film and the tour, their rave public reception, and the associated critical discourses as the biggest cultural phenomena of 2023 summer, explaining that \"beneath their slick, exuberant pop surfaces, [both the film and the tour] tell female coming-of-age stories marked by existential crises and bitter confrontations with sexism.\" Ben Sisario considered both the works as critiques of patriarchy, while Talia Lakritz of Business Insider said both of them \"reclaim girlhood without rescinding power\". Similarly, Chris Willman stated that both use patriarchy as a subject of irony \"while being utterly friendly to and welcoming of men as much as anybody\", eventually becoming a billion-dollar-earning phenomenon.\n\n\n=== Masculinity ===\nIn the Los Angeles Times, Jean Guerrero presented a subtext to the film's feminist exterior, in which \"a world that disregards men and their feelings is an inverted form of patriarchy and also cruel\", and added: \"The film is a rare product of mainstream culture that invites men to reimagine masculinity for their own sake. It acknowledges the identity crisis and loss of hope, economic promise and life purpose among American men. These struggles are often ignored by progressives, but conveniently and poisonously exploited by right-wing manfluencers from Andrew Tate to Josh Hawley [...] The film's reception has focused on its messages of women's empowerment, but what makes it a radical story is that it also invites women to reimagine feminism so that it doesn't ignore male struggles\".Nicholas Balaisis contended in Psychology Today that Barbie provides a \"relatively nuanced portrayal of masculinity\" in two cases that resonated with issues and concerns frequent in clinical psychology and therapy: In the first case, which concerns the \"over-valuation of a woman's gaze and attention on male sense of self-esteem, and even an existential sense of identity\", Ken turns to patriarchal expression and masculine dominance \"over other men, women or objects\" because he does not receive the \"sense of attractiveness, worth, and general self-value\" he wants from Barbie's gaze and attention. In the second case, which concerns \"the relationship to shame or existential solitude and the conversion to sex-as-soothing\",", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e6bf585f-81ac-44df-9d8b-2e720bb41df2": {"__data__": {"id_": "e6bf585f-81ac-44df-9d8b-2e720bb41df2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"title": "Barbie (film)"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6aa5e3b6-b264-411d-867e-67476cc15e77", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "5e740aafdfef80aa296a2312b236eca58eca37456147fafc40f779636a923c46"}, "2": {"node_id": "f0301c4f-efb2-4f37-b2b8-3d8f163582be", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "3bab68cab7dccebff29cd9419bf3a91d7d28dd26e054645abfb23bb1423774c5"}}, "hash": "642994952c58351f81e095cf550d903e529613fa79301e704e7662969cda9901", "text": "concerns \"the relationship to shame or existential solitude and the conversion to sex-as-soothing\", when Barbie approaches Ken in the third act of the film for consolation, he interprets it as a sexual advance and tries to kiss her, which Dr. Balaisis likened to \"the same way that shame can quickly morph into resentment and anger, here we see loneliness and existential angst being converted into a sexual plea \u2014 for sex to solve and resolve these bad feelings\".Megan Garber of The Atlantic found Ken and his journey of self-discovery \"mimics adolescence\", describing \"Like any teenager, Ken is figuring out who he is, and trying the world\u2019s possibilities on for size. But his immaturity is not contained, and this is its problem. His adolescent approach to the world, instead, inflicts itself on everyone else\". Garber concluded that Ken embodies a \"core idea\" in the film \"that patriarchy is a profound form of immaturity\". Eliana Dockterman of Time noted that Ken's radicalization resembles the men's rights movement, particularly in his \"feelings of emasculation\" and evangelization of the patriarchy.\n\n\n== See also ==\nExistentialism in film and television\nList of Barbie films\nSelf-reflection\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website \nBarbie at IMDb", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d7010aea-403f-49a5-b66a-645a236da822": {"__data__": {"id_": "d7010aea-403f-49a5-b66a-645a236da822", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"title": "Oppenheimer (film)"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d35fc534-920c-49a6-8f97-d762f1533384", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "94b3b84af08acdc26ab88f028fb39fee29b2d6ac99cc20d6cc7801d41c1d3025"}, "3": {"node_id": "4bc19d13-1fe6-4d47-a25f-dde433052cb0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "80eee1be80bc2ea6c73f52cb872ff2e0ba54b1f42ad62aabddd184e2e8f3acb6"}}, "hash": "831ffa6ce9e54cd796055572ca4167c6502145b386f45876e4b49e9a23dfae5a", "text": "Oppenheimer ( OP-\u0259n-hy-m\u0259r) is a 2023 biographical film written and directed by Christopher Nolan. It stars Cillian Murphy as J. Robert Oppenheimer, the American theoretical physicist credited with being the \"father of the atomic bomb\" for his role in the Manhattan Project\u2014the World War II undertaking that developed the first nuclear weapons. Based on the 2005 biography American Prometheus by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin, the film chronicles the career of Oppenheimer, with the story predominantly focusing on his studies, his direction of the Manhattan Project during World War II, and his eventual fall from grace due to his 1954 security hearing. The film also stars Emily Blunt as Oppenheimer's wife \"Kitty\", Matt Damon as head of the Manhattan Project Leslie Groves, Robert Downey Jr. as U.S. Atomic Energy Commission member Lewis Strauss, and Florence Pugh as Oppenheimer's communist lover Jean Tatlock. The ensemble supporting cast includes Josh Hartnett, Casey Affleck, Rami Malek, and Kenneth Branagh.\nThe film was announced in September 2021 after Universal Pictures won a bidding war for Nolan's screenplay, following Nolan's conflict with longtime distributor Warner Bros. Murphy was the first cast member to sign on the following month, with the rest of the cast joining between November 2021 and April 2022. Pre-production was under way by January 2022, and filming took place from February to May. Oppenheimer was filmed in a combination of IMAX 65 mm and 65 mm large-format film, including, for the first time, select scenes in IMAX black-and-white film photography. Like his previous works, Nolan made extensive use of practical effects, with minimal computer-generated imagery used to perfect the former. Editing was handled by Jennifer Lame, and the score was composed by Ludwig G\u00f6ransson. The film is Nolan's fourth to receive an R-rating in the United States, preceded by Following (1998), Memento (2000) and Insomnia (2002).\nOppenheimer premiered at Le Grand Rex in Paris on July 11, 2023, and was theatrically released in the United States and the United Kingdom on July 21 by Universal. Its simultaneous release with Warner Bros.'s Barbie led to the Barbenheimer cultural phenomenon, which encouraged audiences to see both films as a double feature.

Robert Oppenheimer grapples with anxiety and homesickness while studying under experimental physicist Patrick Blackett at the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge. An upset Oppenheimer leaves the demanding Blackett a poisoned apple but later retrieves it. Visiting scientist Niels Bohr recommends that Oppenheimer should instead study theoretical physics at G\u00f6ttingen. He completes his PhD there and meets Isidor Isaac Rabi. The two later meet theoretical physicist Werner Heisenberg in Switzerland. Wanting to expand quantum physics research in the United States, Oppenheimer begins teaching at the University of California, Berkeley, and the California Institute of Technology. He meets his future wife, Katherine \"Kitty\" Puening, a biologist and ex-communist, and has an intermittent affair with Jean Tatlock, a troubled Communist Party USA member who later commits suicide.\nIn December 1938, nuclear fission is discovered, which Oppenheimer realizes could be weaponized. In 1942, amid World War II, U.S. Army General Leslie Groves recruits Oppenheimer to lead the Manhattan Project to develop an atomic bomb. Oppenheimer, who is Jewish, is particularly driven by the Nazis potentially completing their nuclear weapons program, headed by Heisenberg. He assembles a scientific team including Rabi and Edward Teller in Los Alamos, New Mexico, and also collaborates with scientists Enrico Fermi, Leo Szilard and David L. Hill at the University of Chicago. Teller's calculations reveal an atomic detonation could possibly trigger a catastrophic chain reaction that ignites the atmosphere. After consulting with Albert Einstein, Oppenheimer concludes the chances are acceptably low. Teller proposes constructing a hydrogen bomb which is swiftly rejected.

He attempts to leave the project, but Oppenheimer convinces him to stay.\nUpon Adolf Hitler's death in 1945, some Project scientists question the bomb's relevance, while Oppenheimer believes it will end the ongoing war in the Pacific and save Allied lives. The Trinity test is successful, and President Harry S. Truman orders Hiroshima and Nagasaki to be bombed, forcing Japan's surrender. Though publicly praised, Oppenheimer is haunted by the mass destruction and fatalities, and urges restricting further nuclear weapons development, which Truman curtly dismisses. As an advisor to the United States Atomic Energy Commission (AEC), Oppenheimer's stance generates controversy, while Teller's hydrogen bomb receives renewed interest amid the burgeoning Cold War. AEC Chairman Lewis Strauss resents Oppenheimer for having publicly humiliating him by dismissing his concerns about exporting radioisotopes, and for recommending negotiations with the Soviet Union after they successfully detonated their own bomb. He also believes that Oppenheimer denigrated him to Einstein in 1947.\nIn 1954, wanting to eliminate Oppenheimer's political influence, Strauss secretly orchestrates a private hearing before a Personnel Security Board concerning Oppenheimer's Q clearance. However, it becomes clear that the hearing has a predetermined outcome. Oppenheimer's past communist ties is exploited and Groves' and other associates' testimony is twisted against him. Teller testifies that he lacks confidence in Oppenheimer and recommends revocation. The board revokes Oppenheimer's clearance, damaging his public image and limiting his influence on nuclear policy. In 1959, during Strauss' Senate confirmation hearing for Secretary of Commerce, Hill testifies about Strauss' personal motives in engineering Oppenheimer's downfall, resulting in the Senate voting against his nomination. In 1963, President Lyndon B. Johnson presents Oppenheimer with the Enrico Fermi Award as a gesture of political rehabilitation. A flashback to Oppenheimer's 1947 conversation with Einstein reveals that Strauss was never mentioned, and Oppenheimer instead expressed his somber belief that he did indeed start a chain reaction that would destroy the world.\n\n\n== Cast ==\n\nCillian Murphy as J.

At one point Oliver Stone was offered the opportunity to direct, but turned it down because he \"couldn't find my way to its essence\". In 2015, J. David Wargo optioned the book, then commissioned and rejected several scripts. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Wargo flew to Hollywood to meet with actor James Woods, who set up a meeting with Charles Roven, a producer for various Christopher Nolan films, and in turn, Roven gave a copy of the book to Nolan. Both Wargo and Woods are executive producers of the film.Nolan had long desired to make a film about Oppenheimer, even prior to reading American Prometheus. In 2019, towards the end of production on Nolan's science-fiction film Tenet (2020), star Robert Pattinson gave the director a book of Oppenheimer's speeches. According to Nolan, the speeches showed the physicist \"wrestling with the implications ... of what's happened and what [he's] done\". Nolan wanted to depict \"what it would have been like to be Oppenheimer in those moments\" in contrast to Tenet, which employs time travel to curb a potential weapon of mass destruction.In December 2020, Warner Bros. Pictures announced plans to give its 2021 films simultaneous releases in theaters and on HBO Max, citing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the film industry. Nolan, who had partnered with the studio on each one of his films starting with Insomnia (2002), was outraged with the decision as he had been a proponent of film theaters. In January 2021, media reports mentioned the possibility that Nolan's next film could be the first not to be financed or distributed by Warner Bros. By mid-2021, the filmmaker had left Warner Bros. and was meeting with other studios to develop his new project. Nolan had previously supported the studio's decision to give Wonder Woman 1984 (2020) a simultaneous release, stating that he perceived that situation to have been handled properly, but said he had been excluded from any discussions regarding the postponed release of Tenet.In September 2021, it was announced that Nolan would write and direct a biographical film set during World War II about Oppenheimer, with Cillian Murphy in negotiations to star.

Due to his strained relationship with Warner Bros., Nolan approached multiple studios for the project, including Sony, Universal, Paramount, and Apple. According to insiders, Paramount was ruled out early in the process in relation to the replacement of CEO and chairman Jim Gianopulos with Brian Robbins, an advocate for increased streaming-service releases. Nolan had connections to Donna Langley, the chairwoman and chief content officer of the NBCUniversal studio group, who agreed with his stance in favor of traditional film exhibition in theaters. As such, Universal agreed to finance and distribute Oppenheimer, with production set to begin in the first quarter of 2022. The studio also agreed to Nolan's terms, which included a production budget of $100 million, an equal marketing budget, an exclusive theatrical window ranging from 90 to 120 days, 20 percent of the film's first-dollar gross, and a three-week period both before and after the film's opening in which Universal could not release another new film.\n\n\n=== Writing ===\nOppenheimer is the first screenplay written by Nolan in the first person, as he wanted the narrative to be conveyed from Oppenheimer's perspective. He described the \"texture\" of the film being \"how the personal interacts with the historic and the geopolitical\" with the intention of making it a cautionary tale. He began developing the script after he completed Tenet and wrote it in only a few months; he had already been thinking about making a film about Oppenheimer for over 20 years. A major plot element is Oppenheimer's response to the long-term consequences of his actions. Nolan wished to explore the phenomenon of delayed reactions, as he felt people are not \"necessarily confronted with the strongest or worst elements of [their actions] in the moment\". He also chose to alternate between scenes in color and black-and-white to convey the story from both subjective and objective perspectives, respectively, with most of Oppenheimer's view shown via the former, while the latter depicts a \"more objective view of his story from a different character's point of view\". Wanting to make the film as subjective as possible, the production team decided to include visions of Oppenheimer's conceptions of the quantum world and waves of energy. Nolan noted that Oppenheimer never publicly apologized for his role in the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, but still desired to portray Oppenheimer as feeling genuine guilt for his", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d91807d9-0a00-42af-adc6-e39acef64383": {"__data__": {"id_": "d91807d9-0a00-42af-adc6-e39acef64383", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"title": "Oppenheimer (film)"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d35fc534-920c-49a6-8f97-d762f1533384", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "94b3b84af08acdc26ab88f028fb39fee29b2d6ac99cc20d6cc7801d41c1d3025"}, "2": {"node_id": "c674a3fa-79fd-4d38-a1a3-11eee8b8355a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "db83d60fdcef6e2e898e79b92ccc2cceaaeb670127fb209a01ec3646e30dea61"}, "3": {"node_id": "3a182c6d-76e7-41e2-950a-b592e08eb542", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "a695150db18d0181245dd273f377ad727665c7fef5da8b26d4e05744b0593465"}}, "hash": "be5a0f1351f1760de73403b3c6a7c6cd759504f30d3145923fe2705c2d1f6580", "text": "of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, but still desired to portray Oppenheimer as feeling genuine guilt for his actions, believing this to be accurate.\n\nNolan began by trying to find the \"thread that connected the quantum realm, the vibration of energy, and Oppenheimer's own personal journey\" and sought to portray the difficulties in his life, particularly regarding his sex life. As such, Nolan wanted to candidly portray his affair with Jean Tatlock. He also wanted to explore Tatlock's influence on Oppenheimer's life, since she was a Communist, which had \"enormous ramifications for [Oppenheimer's] later life and his ultimate fate\". Nolan also sought to explore the relationship between Oppenheimer and Admiral Lewis Strauss, former chair of the Atomic Energy Commission, having been inspired by the relationship between Mozart and Antonio Salieri as depicted in Amadeus (1984).Another critical moment of the film was the meeting in which President Harry S. Truman called Oppenheimer a \"crybaby\". Nolan wanted to convey the scene from Oppenheimer's perspective and felt it was a \"massive moment of disillusion, a huge turning point [for Oppenheimer] in his approach to trying to deal with the consequences of what he'd been involved with\", while also underscoring that it is a \"huge shift in perception about the reality of Oppenheimer's perception\". He wanted to execute a quick tonal shift after the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, desiring to go from the \"highest triumphalism, the highest high, to the lowest low in the shortest amount of screen time possible\". For the ending, Nolan chose to make it intentionally vague to be open to interpretation and refrained from being didactic or conveying specific messages in his work. However, he did have the intention to have a \"strong set of troubling reverberations at the end\".Nolan first became aware of Oppenheimer as a youth, after hearing the lyric \"How can I save my little boy from Oppenheimer's deadly toy?\" in the Sting song \"Russians\" (1985). He was also inspired by his fears of nuclear holocaust throughout childhood, as he lived during the era of Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND) and the anti-nuclear protests in RAF Greenham Common. He felt that \"while our relationship with that [nuclear] fear has ebbed and flowed with time, the threat itself never actually went away\", and", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3a182c6d-76e7-41e2-950a-b592e08eb542": {"__data__": {"id_": "3a182c6d-76e7-41e2-950a-b592e08eb542", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"title": "Oppenheimer (film)"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d35fc534-920c-49a6-8f97-d762f1533384", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "94b3b84af08acdc26ab88f028fb39fee29b2d6ac99cc20d6cc7801d41c1d3025"}, "2": {"node_id": "d91807d9-0a00-42af-adc6-e39acef64383", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "be5a0f1351f1760de73403b3c6a7c6cd759504f30d3145923fe2705c2d1f6580"}, "3": {"node_id": "4012de7e-813b-4843-9332-c378af32dd9f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "d8d52d3d9c8fe765788bc997b1654e2c9605a0a28082adeac40ee8683aa15610"}}, "hash": "a695150db18d0181245dd273f377ad727665c7fef5da8b26d4e05744b0593465", "text": "fear has ebbed and flowed with time, the threat itself never actually went away\", and felt the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine had caused a resurgence of nuclear anxiety. Nolan had also penned a script for a biopic of Howard Hughes approximately during the time of production of Martin Scorsese's The Aviator (2004), which had given him insight on how to write a script regarding a person's life. Emily Blunt described the Oppenheimer script as \"emotional\" and resembling that of a thriller, while also remarking that Nolan had \"Trojan-Horsed a biopic into a thriller\".\n\n\n=== Casting ===\nOppenheimer marks the sixth collaboration between Nolan and Murphy, and the first starring Murphy as the lead. To prepare for the role, the actor did what he summarized as \"an awful lot of reading\" on Oppenheimer's life and had also been inspired by David Bowie's appearance in the 1970s. Nolan called Murphy one day to ask him to play the part, and Murphy enthusiastically accepted and was excited to play a lead role in a Nolan film. Afterward, Nolan flew to Dublin to meet with Murphy, who read the script in Nolan's hotel room. Murphy lost an undisclosed amount of weight for the role in order to better match the real-life Oppenheimer's gaunt appearance. Nolan also set up a phone call between Murphy and Nobel laureate Kip Thorne, who had previously worked with Nolan on Interstellar (2014). As a graduate student, Thorne had attended some of Oppenheimer's seminars, and explained to Murphy his experience with Oppenheimer's gift for facilitating group discussions of difficult scientific concepts.The casting process was so secretive that some cast members did not know which role they would be playing until they signed on. Robert Downey Jr., Matt Damon, and Emily Blunt took pay cuts to work on the film, with each earning $4 million in lieu of their usual $10\u201320 million upfront salary. Downey went to Nolan's house to read the script, which was printed in black on red paper. Downey would later describe Oppenheimer as \"the best film\" in which he has appeared to date. Blunt met Nolan in Los Angeles and, when she was offered the role of Katherine \"Kitty\" Oppenheimer, she enthusiastically accepted; she also contacted Murphy to get an expectation of what working with Nolan would be like.

Nolan cast writer-director Benny Safdie as physicist Edward Teller after asking director Paul Thomas Anderson about his experience directing Safdie in Licorice Pizza (2021). Safdie had worked alongside a nuclear physicist at Columbia University while in high school.It is Nolan's first film since Batman Begins (2005) to not feature Michael Caine. When asked about Caine's absence from the film, Nolan stated, \"He's with us in spirit, but not an actual actor. No, no. He wasn't able to join us for this one. But he's always with us in spirit, and I've had the most wonderful collaboration with him over the years.\"\n\n\n=== Filming ===\n\nPre-production had begun by January 2022 in New Mexico, where a two-day casting call took place in Santa Fe and Los Alamos for people to audition to play local residents, military personnel, and scientists. Another casting call was held in February.Principal photography began on February 28, 2022, at Ghost Ranch in New Mexico, and lasted for 57 days with Hoyte van Hoytema serving as cinematographer. The original shooting schedule had set aside approximately 85 days for principal photography. During pre-production, it had become clear there was no way to shoot a feature film for $100 million over that many days on location all over the United States. To free up money in the film's budget for location shooting in California and New Jersey and for construction of high-quality historically accurate sets in New Mexico, Nolan compressed the shooting schedule to 55 days.  Murphy, who appears in nearly every scene, described the pace as \"insane\".Gary Oldman said he would be on set for a day in May for \"one scene, a page and a half\". Nolan filmed his eldest child, his daughter Flora, in a scene in which she played a young woman disintegrated in a nuclear explosion. It appears in the film as one of Oppenheimer's visions, in which Nolan intended to show \"that if you create the ultimate destructive power, it will also destroy those", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "613998af-eb6b-4c74-8249-f78740a358a4": {"__data__": {"id_": "613998af-eb6b-4c74-8249-f78740a358a4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"title": "Oppenheimer (film)"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d35fc534-920c-49a6-8f97-d762f1533384", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "94b3b84af08acdc26ab88f028fb39fee29b2d6ac99cc20d6cc7801d41c1d3025"}, "2": {"node_id": "4012de7e-813b-4843-9332-c378af32dd9f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "d8d52d3d9c8fe765788bc997b1654e2c9605a0a28082adeac40ee8683aa15610"}, "3": {"node_id": "80c1d476-e876-4289-8fb1-d908b41a8aad", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "3caf472255f5ca6d6c69b8ae2b912a3830a0e1073a6f833d86813736f3a12ab7"}}, "hash": "fc68db2551f72a97c5794ae0fccc67fb46a95250bfdc2b6359e7d285f29f51cf", "text": "which Nolan intended to show \"that if you create the ultimate destructive power, it will also destroy those who are near and dear to you\".The film used a combination of IMAX 65 mm and 65 mm large-format film. It is also the first film to shoot sections on IMAX black-and-white photographic film, which Kodak created and FotoKem developed specifically for the film. Van Hoytema used 50mm and 80mm Hasselblad lenses when filming on the IMAX MKIV or IMAX MSM 9802 cameras, while scenes shot on the Panavision Panaflex System 65 Studio cameras were shot using Panavision Sphero 65 and Panavision System 65 lenses. Said Van Hoytema, \"When shooting our close-ups, we didn't want the camera to be six feet away from our subject. We wanted to be much tighter, so that you really feel the perspective and the intimacy. Also, I knew we would be filming in low-light situations and would need to shoot at T1.4 rather than a T4.\" Additionally, the production had Panavision construct a custom probe lens to allow the filmmakers to use IMAX cameras for macro photography to record the film's miniature effects. In the second week of April, filming took place on location at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey. Filming also occurred in California, primarily around the campus of the University of California, Berkeley.During a 2021 research trip, Nolan discovered that Los Alamos had drastically changed from its 1940s appearance and could not be used for exterior shots of the town; for example, the town's equivalent of a Main Street has a Starbucks. Instead, the production team constructed a version of 1940s-era Los Alamos on top of a similar plateau at Ghost Ranch. It took three months to build the set, which was used for only six shooting days. The production also shot some scenes on location in the real town of Los Alamos starting on March 8, 2022. Many scenes in the film take place in academic lecture halls; to save time and money, the production team decided against attempting to reconstruct those halls as sets at Ghost Ranch, and shot them inside a historic Women's Army Corps dormitory in Los Alamos. Scenes were also filmed in Oppenheimer's original cabin in Los Alamos, which had been restored.

Kai Bird visited the set and was impressed by Murphy's performance as Oppenheimer during filming.Filming involved the use of real explosives to recreate the Trinity nuclear test, forgoing the use of computer-generated graphics. When this news first broke online, many fans (aware of Nolan's famous preference for in-camera practical effects) thought it meant he had set off a real atomic bomb. Nolan later remarked that it was both \"flattering\" and \"scary\" that his fans would think that of him. The production team was able to obtain government permission to film at White Sands Missile Range, but only at highly inconvenient hours, and therefore chose to film the scene elsewhere in the New Mexico desert. The production filmed the Trinity test scenes in Belen, New Mexico, with Murphy climbing a 100-foot steel tower, a replica of the original site used in the Manhattan Project, in rough weather. A special set was built in which gasoline, propane, aluminum powder, and magnesium were used to create the explosive effect. Although they used miniatures for the practical effect, the film's special effects supervisor Scott R. Fisher referred to them as \"big-atures\", since the special effects team had tried to build the models as physically large as possible. To make the models look closer to their intended real-life size, the team used forced perspective. Visualizations of the interactions between atoms, molecules and energy waves, as well as the depiction of stars, black holes and supernovas, were also achieved through practical methods. Nolan claimed the film contains no computer-generated effects, and used practical effects to achieve \"real-world imagery\". Filming wrapped in May 2022.\n\n\n=== Post-production ===\nDuring post-production, editing was completed by Jennifer Lame, who had previously edited Tenet. While inspecting the footage during editing, Nolan and Lame performed \"character passes\" to ensure all the characters were properly displayed on screen, due to the film having a faster pace than most traditional blockbusters. Visual effects were handled by DNEG, which produced more than 100 VFX shots from more than 400 practically shot elements, marking their eighth collaboration with Nolan. Andrew Jackson was the visual effects supervisor, who stated that the film utilized mostly \"invisible\" visual effects through \"'in-camera' special effects created on set\".

G\u00f6ransson's score was featured in a trailer for the film on May 8, 2023. It was also featured in the Universal Pictures exclusive five-minute Opening Look on July 13. Nolan had advised him to use the violin for Oppenheimer's central theme in the film, with G\u00f6ransson remarking that he had felt that it could go from \"the most romantic, beautiful tone in a split second to neurotic and heart wrenching, horror sounds\".\n\n\n== Release ==\n\n\n=== Marketing ===\nOppenheimer's teaser trailer was released on July 28, 2022, featuring a live countdown to 5:29 a.m. (MDT) on July 16, 2023, the 78th anniversary of the first detonation of an atomic weapon; it premiered in screenings of Nope before being posted online on Universal's social media profiles. Empire commented that it is exemplary of Nolan's style: \"heady, brooding stuff with a real sense of weight\". In December 2022, two trailers for the film premiered in front of Avatar: The Way of Water, with one being exclusive to IMAX theaters and the other being shown in all other formats. The latter was eventually released online. In May 2023, an official main trailer debuted during preview screenings of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3. It was subsequently released to the public on May 8, 2023, alongside a theatrical release poster.\n\n\n=== Theatrical release ===\nOppenheimer had its world premiere at Le Grand Rex in Paris on July 11, 2023, followed by the British premiere at Odeon Luxe Leicester Square in London on July 13, and the American premiere at AMC Loews Lincoln Square in New York City on July 17.

Oppenheimer was released theatrically on July 21, 2023, by Universal Pictures. In addition to standard digital cinemas, it will be also released in various film formats including IMAX 70 mm (30 prints), standard 70 mm (113 prints) and 35 mm (around 80 prints).The film was released on the same day as Barbie, a fantasy comedy film directed by Greta Gerwig based on Mattel's Barbie fashion dolls and media franchise, and distributed by Warner Bros. Many speculated that the decision by Warner Bros. to release Barbie on the same day as Oppenheimer was made in order to deplete ticket sales of Oppenheimer as retaliation for Nolan releasing the film with Universal. Due to the tonal and genre dissonance between the two films, many social media users created memes about how the two films appealed to different audiences, and how they should be viewed as a double feature. The trend was dubbed \"Barbenheimer\", and was labeled as counterprogramming during a summer of \"entertainment industry meltdown\". In an interview with La Vanguardia, Cillian Murphy endorsed the phenomenon, saying \"My advice would be for people to go see both, on the same day. If they are good films, then that's cinema's gain.\"As of March 2022, Universal Pictures halted the release of its titles in Russia, joining other major American film distributors in the boycott against the country following its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Oppenheimer consequently did not have a Russian release.In Japan, the only country to have been attacked by nuclear bombs, the film is yet to have a release date. In late June 2023, a Universal Pictures spokesperson told Variety that \"plans have not been finalized in all markets\". Variety also pointed out that it is not uncommon for American films to be released in Japan months after the theatrical debut in the United States. The Economist suggested that due to the film's controversial theme in Japan, it may never get released there.\n\n\n==== Classifications and censorship ====\nIn the United States, the film received an R-rating from the Motion Picture Association for \"some sexuality, nudity, and language\", meaning anyone under 17 needs to be accompanied by an adult guardian. It is Nolan's first film to receive that rating since Insomnia (2002). In Australia, the film received an MA 15+ rating from the Australian Classification Board board for \"strong", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "276c4342-9703-4beb-95ff-d66b821acc55": {"__data__": {"id_": "276c4342-9703-4beb-95ff-d66b821acc55", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"title": "Oppenheimer (film)"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d35fc534-920c-49a6-8f97-d762f1533384", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "94b3b84af08acdc26ab88f028fb39fee29b2d6ac99cc20d6cc7801d41c1d3025"}, "2": {"node_id": "589b88fd-4658-4072-9d1b-a4c60e3a5350", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "83197ca5af3210cfe0fabbf55ee70d07ad4f97a2a9b73468a1fe07ae1c2e25f3"}, "3": {"node_id": "6a610fc8-42b1-4e2f-b955-bd860c959fb8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "0beceb4be81c8881c67d9898b6609433df4c64457a111d5253e91e767c7e1b64"}}, "hash": "07dc15b5b4594f158e9ac1fb902e056669ff47d74af70467c492a7de2374f0b9", "text": "In Australia, the film received an MA 15+ rating from the Australian Classification Board board for \"strong sex and a suicide scene\". In the United Kingdom, the film received a 15 certificate from the British Board of Film Classification for \"strong language and sex\", meaning anyone under the age of 15 cannot be admitted to view the film. In some countries, including those in the Middle East, South Asia and Southeast Asia, Universal distributed a version of the film with Florence Pugh's nude body covered by a computer-generated black dress.\n\n\n==== India ====\n\nIn India, Oppenheimer was released with all instances of nudity, sex and cigarette smoking scenes censored (but not cut) by the filmmakers, earning the U/A certificate from the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) while retaining the running time. The audio from the scene, where Tatlock directs Oppenheimer to read a verse from the Hindu scripture Bhagavad Gita, \"I am become Death, destroyer of worlds\", while the two have intercourse, remained intact. As NDTV reported, the Minister for Information and Broadcasting Anurag Thakur questioned how the CBFC certified the film with the verse heard during such circumstance in the first place, and asked the scene to be deleted.The Hindu right in India took offence at and demanded the removal of the scene. Among them was journalist Uday Mahurkar, who wrote an open letter to Nolan calling the scene a \"direct assault on religious beliefs of a billion tolerant Hindus\", and demanded its removal from all releases of Oppenheimer across the world. On the other hand, actor Nitish Bharadwaj, who played Krishna in the television series Mahabharat, told The Times of India that \"The use of this verse in the film should also be understood from Oppenheimer's emotional state of mind. A scientist thinks of his creation 24x7x365 days, irrespective of what he is doing. His mind space is consumed fully of his creation & the physical act is just a natural mechanical act.\"\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\n\n=== Box office ===\nAs of October 3, 2023, Oppenheimer has grossed $322.6 million in the United States and Canada and $611.3 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $933.9 million.

It is also the highest grossing World War II-related film, surpassing Dunkirk (2017). Additionally, Oppenheimer became one of the top five highest-grossing IMAX releases, earning $176 million (approximately 20% of its total gross), over $17 million of which was earned from the 30 screens showing IMAX 70mm prints.\n\n\n==== United States and Canada ====\nIn the United States and Canada, Oppenheimer was released alongside Barbie. The week of their releases, AMC Theatres announced that over 40,000 AMC Stubs members had already pre-booked tickets to both films on the same day. After grossing $33 million on its first day (including $10.5 million from Thursday night previews), it went on to debut to $82.5 million, finishing second behind Barbie and marking one of the best opening weekends ever for an R-rated drama. 64% of the audience was male, with 33% being 18\u201334 years old. The Barbenheimer phenomenon was credited with boosting interest in the film, with a total of 79% of tickets sold over the weekend being for the two films (27% for Oppenheimer), a combined total of 18.5 million people. The film's opening weekend was Nolan's best for an original film, being the highest of his filmography outside of the latter two films from The Dark Knight trilogy. It achieved the third-highest opening weekend for a biopic film, behind The Passion of the Christ (2004) and American Sniper (2014). The film made $46.2 million in its second weekend (a drop of 44%), remaining in second behind Barbie.

Hindustan Times reported that the film was also hailed as one of the best films of the 21st century. On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 93% of 469 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 8.6/10. The website's consensus reads: \"Oppenheimer marks another engrossing achievement from Christopher Nolan that benefits from Murphy's tour-de-force performance and stunning visuals.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 88 out of 100, based on 69 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".

The A.V. Club's Matthew Jackson deemed it a \"masterpiece\", adding that \"it's Christopher Nolan's best film so far, a step up to a new level for one of our finest filmmakers, and a movie that burns itself into your brain\".Empire's Dan Jolin labeled it a \"masterfully constructed character study\", taking particular note of Murphy's performance and van Hoytema's IMAX cinematography. Peter Suderman writing for Reason magazine said that the film leaves the viewer with a sense of \"fear and foreboding about the horror of full-on nuclear conflict in the wake of the nuclear bomb. Humanity is both great and terrible. Oppenheimer isn't just a movie\u2014it's a warning.\" Matt Zoller Seitz, writing for RogerEbert.com gave Oppenheimer a full four stars rating. He lauded Nolan's storytelling, exploration of Oppenheimer's character, and the film's technical achievements, concluding: \"As a physical experience, Oppenheimer is something else entirely\u2014it's hard to say exactly what, and that's what's so fascinating about it\".Peter Travers described the film as a \"monumental achievement\" and \"one of the best films you'll see anywhere\". Caryn James of BBC Culture similarly termed it \"boldly imaginative and [Nolan's] most mature work yet\", adding that it combined the \"explosive, commercially-enticing action of The Dark Knight trilogy\" with the \"cerebral underpinnings\" of Memento, Inception and Tenet. IGN critic Siddhant Adlakha gave Oppenheimer 10/10, describing it as \"a three-hour biopic that plays like a jolting thriller\" and Nolan's most \"abstract\" work yet.Saibal Chatterjee from NDTV rated the film 4.5 stars out of 5 and stated: \"Oppenheimer, a cinematic achievement of blinding brilliance, achieves a sublime combination of visual grandeur, technical", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "dbce39ee-2d01-412c-a2fe-62af2a890475": {"__data__": {"id_": "dbce39ee-2d01-412c-a2fe-62af2a890475", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"title": "Oppenheimer (film)"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d35fc534-920c-49a6-8f97-d762f1533384", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "94b3b84af08acdc26ab88f028fb39fee29b2d6ac99cc20d6cc7801d41c1d3025"}, "2": {"node_id": "e78951af-d46d-4c53-812f-ebc65eeb0840", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "51d37f71afe1a9cf32214a68735fa8ddf3868eee945d6dcd442b3cac19036b81"}, "3": {"node_id": "5a669901-473f-4284-ade4-6e26e76571c8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "ffc84bc85bf1c84e85cbd9d985ce077c6cbcd122d6722a75ae47b4e5f18b9808"}}, "hash": "96045d5c1775352d259139d6c1d792d742d4890b58e51d3734edb5e0f2bee0b5", "text": "a cinematic achievement of blinding brilliance, achieves a sublime combination of visual grandeur, technical flair, emotional intimacy and an examination of the limits of human endeavor and ambition\". In August 2023, it ranked number 3 on Collider's list of \"The 20 Best Drama Movies of the 2020s So Far,\" writing that Nolan \"explores the world's obsession with destructive nuclear weapons from the perspective of their creator; using the Greek myth of Dante  [sic] as an inspiration, Oppenheimer makes it clear that once this type of power is unleashed, it is bound to be used again.\"Despite praising the film's themes and performances, CNN's Brian Lowry believed that \"Nolan juggles a lot, in a way that somewhat works to the movie's detriment\". While acknowledging the contribution of \"American scientists and American enterprise\", Brett Mason noted that the film omits the crucial contributions of non-Americans that ensured the work was able to commence as early as December 1941: \"Nolan completely ignores the crucial role that British science and Australian physicist Mark Oliphant played in jump-starting the quest.\"Writing for the Los Angeles Times, Justin Chang staunchly defended Nolan's accurate depiction of how Oppenheimer could not see the true victims of his work. Chang wrote that instead of satisfying \"representational completists\" by detouring to Hiroshima and Nagasaki, \"Nolan treats them instead as a profound absence, an indictment by silence\".\n\n\n=== Accolades ===\nOppenheimer received nominations for Best Thriller, Best Drama TV Spot (for a Feature Film), Best Sound Editing in a TV Spot (for a Feature Film), and Best Thriller TV Spot (for a Feature Film). It won Best Drama, Best Summer 2023 Blockbuster Trailer, and Best Sound Editing at the 2023 Golden Trailer Awards. The film finished as runner-up for Most Anticipated Film at the 6th Hollywood Critics Association Midseason Film Awards.\n\n\n== Influence ==\nThe renewed attention to the site and associated nuclear testing pushed the United States Senate to pass legislation. If passed by Congress, it could provide compensation and health care funding to those who were affected, known as the \"Downwinders\".\n\n\n== Accuracy and omissions ==\nThe film was noted for its accuracy, with some scenes being taken word-for-word out of the book or real life events.

Many of the changes are small embellishments or changes from real life. For example, Oppenheimer was not as excited about his discovery of black holes as shown in the film, since he did not know how significant it would become; the study was indeed released on the same day Germany invaded Poland, as shown in the film. During the Trinity test, Donald Hornig had his hand on the kill switch for a faster reaction time, not near it as depicted in the film. Truman did call Oppenheimer a \"crybaby\", but in a letter to Dean Acheson one year later, not immediately after meeting Oppenheimer.The scene where Oppenheimer poisons his professor's apple is based on accounts that Oppenheimer gave of the incident, but it is unclear whether it occurred in real life. In the film, Oppenheimer is depicted as putting potassium cyanide in the apple before having a change of heart the next day, and then narrowly preventing the apple from being eaten. There is no evidence that Niels Bohr nearly ate the apple, or had any involvement in the incident.Oppenheimer and Einstein were friends, but the specific conversations which the film revolves around never happened. Oppenheimer took his concerns about an unstoppable chain reaction to Arthur Compton, not Einstein.In addition to their interpersonal conflicts, Strauss had another reason to undermine Oppenheimer's credibility by revoking his security clearance: Oppenheimer was opposed to further development of the hydrogen bomb by the United States. Scott Sagan describes the loss of Oppenheimer's influence to constrain the nuclear arms race between the U.S. and the Soviet Union as a \"broader tragedy\" less clearly depicted in the film than the scientist's personal tragedy, but he called the production highly accurate otherwise for a \"Hollywood movie\".Many efforts undertaken at other Manhattan Project sites, such as Hanford, Washington and Oak Ridge, Tennessee were not shown. Most of them, overseen by General Leslie Groves, focused on producing the nuclear explosives. In addition to the team from Los Alamos, those working at other Project sites, particularly the University of Chicago's Metallurgical Laboratory, also expressed concerns about using the atomic bomb against Japan.The countdown for the Trinity test is shown on Nixie tubes, these were only invented in 1955.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of films about nuclear issues\nList of World War II films since
