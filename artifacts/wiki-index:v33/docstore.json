CDP Cities provides a global platform based upon a simple questionnaire that allows city governments to disclose their greenhouse gas emission data publicly. One of the greatest values of the annual report, first released in June 2011, is to city leaders who can identify peers who are addressing similar risks and issues with new and innovative strategies for reducing carbon emissions and for mitigating risk from climate change.\n\n\n=== Carbon Action initiative ===\nCarbon Action is an investor-led initiative which shows how companies in investment portfolios are managing carbon emissions and energy efficiency.\nOver 300 investors with US$25 trillion in assets under management ask the world's highest emitting companies to take three specific actions in response to climate change:\n\nMake emissions reductions (year-on-year)\nPublicly disclose emission reduction targets\nMake ROI-positive investments in projectsCDP launched a new research series at the beginning of 2015, taking a sector by sector approach.\n\n\n== Leadership indices ==\nCDP recognizes companies with high-quality disclosure in its annual scoring process, with top companies making it onto CDP's so-called A-list.\nScores are calculated according to a standardized method which measures whether and how well, a company responds to each question. A company goes through four main steps, starting with disclosure of their current position, moving to awareness which looks at whether a company is conscious of its environmental impact, to management, and finally leadership.A high CDP score is supposed to be indicative of a company's environmental awareness, advanced sustainability governance and leadership to address climate change.\n\n\n== Organisational structure and governance ==\nCDP", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2b7a4b91-1337-4600-815e-46e077269ea6": {"__data__": {"id_": "2b7a4b91-1337-4600-815e-46e077269ea6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"title": "Carbon Disclosure Project"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a26542c6-e20c-4fc7-991d-8cdf4095d0b2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "41aeff346f019220e914bfced090fd5aab1b216bb2aaec2d05e30e1c7969b423"}, "2": {"node_id": "d890023a-91c5-4ae4-ac33-2d81840e4447", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "cfd43e7e74ae051f4bd3e617a1b71e8b1f87757f2f738294950728ceb13d5501"}, "3": {"node_id": "39761d9c-c80e-4c1a-b0a6-1c6739e38167", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "7d11d3f3b5debbde4156bbf6f89a5d774f2672bcc694af74f238eb53d9a98e08"}}, "hash": "24f9ee1d74420e08a2230bc7f8273f05de4136a1cf4066cbe042b4159f1dd826", "text": "and leadership to address climate change.\n\n\n== Organisational structure and governance ==\nCDP includes three separate legal entities registered in the United Kingdom, Belgium and the United States of America.
