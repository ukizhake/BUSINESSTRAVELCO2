# ### A note on terminology:
# 
# You'll notice that there are quite a few similarities between LangChain and LlamaIndex. LlamaIndex can largely be thought of as an extension to LangChain, in some ways - but they moved some of the language around. Let's spend a few moments disambiguating the language.
# 
# - `QueryEngine` -> `RetrievalQA`:
#   -  `QueryEngine` is just LlamaIndex's way of indicating something is an LLM "chain" on top of a retrieval system
# - `OpenAIAgent` vs. `ZeroShotAgent`:
#   - The two agents have the same fundamental pattern: Decide which of a list of tools to use to answer a user's query.
#   - `OpenAIAgent` (LlamaIndex's primary agent) does not need to rely on an agent excecutor due to the fact that it is leveraging OpenAI's [functional api](https://openai.com/blog/function-calling-and-other-api-updates) which allows the agent to interface "directly" with the tools instead of operating through an intermediary application process.
# 
# There is, however, a much large terminological difference when it comes to discussing data.
# 
# ##### Nodes vs. Documents
# 
# As you're aware of from the previous weeks assignments, there's an idea of `documents` in NLP which refers to text objects that exist within a corpus of documents.
# 
# LlamaIndex takes this a step further and reclassifies `documents` as `nodes`. Confusingly, it refers to the `Source Document` as simply `Documents`.
# 
# The `Document` -> `node` structure is, almost exactly, equivalent to the `Source Document` -> `Document` structure found in LangChain - but the new terminology comes with some clarity about different structure-indices. 
# 
# We won't be leveraging those structured indicies today, but we will be leveraging a "benefit" of the `node` structure that exists as a default in LlamaIndex, which is the ability to quickly filter nodes based on their metadata.

# # Creating a more robust RAQA system using LlamaIndex
# 
# We'll be putting together a system for querying both qualitative and quantitative data using LlamaIndex. 
# 
# To stick to a theme, we'll continue to use BarbenHeimer data as our base - but this can, and should, be extended to other topics/domains.
# 
# # Build üèóÔ∏è
# There are 3 main tasks in this notebook:
# 
# - Create a Qualitative VectorStore query engine
# - Create a quantitative NLtoSQL query engine
# - Combine the two using LlamaIndex's OpenAI agent framework.
# 
# # Ship üö¢
# Create an host a Gradio or Chainlit application to serve your project on Hugging Face spaces.
# 
# # Share üöÄ

    # %% [markdown]
    # #### Context Setting
    # 
    # Now, LlamaIndex has the ability to set `ServiceContext`. You can think of this as a config file of sorts. The basic idea here is that we use this to establish some core properties and then can pass it to various services. 
    # 
    # While we could set this up as a global context, we're going to leave it as `ServiceContext` so we can see where it's applied.
    # 
    # We'll set a few significant contexts:
    # 
    # - `chunk_size` - this is what it says on the tin
    # - `llm` - this is where we can set what model we wish to use as our primary LLM when we're making `QueryEngine`s and more
    # - `embed_model` - this will help us keep our embedding model consistent across use cases
    # 
    # 
    # We'll also create some resources we're going to keep consistent across all of our indices today.
    # 
    # - `text_splitter` - This is what we'll use to split our text, feel free to experiment here
    # - `SimpleNodeParser` - This is what will work in tandem with the `text_splitter` to parse our full sized documents into nodes.
