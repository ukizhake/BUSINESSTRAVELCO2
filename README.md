## <h1 align="center" id="heading">:wave: Welcome to Business Travel CO2 reporting!!</h1>

<!--h4> Sample report
Business travel emissions covered by target (metric tons CO2e)

The average CO2 emissions for business travel by air is 431.0 units.
The average CH4 emissions for business travel by air is 7.15 units.
The average N2O emissions for business travel by air is 14.05 units.

In summary, business travel by air contributes higher average CO2 emissions compared to business travel by rail. However, business travel by rail has higher average CH4 emissions compared to business travel by air. Business travel by air also has higher average N2O emissions compared to business travel by rail.

Report:

The analysis of business travel emissions reveals important insights into the environmental impact of different modes of transportation. 

Business travel by air has an average CO2 emissions of 431.0 units, indicating a significant contribution to greenhouse gas emissions. This highlights the need for sustainable practices and alternative transportation options to reduce the carbon footprint associated with air travel.

On the other hand, business travel by rail has lower average CO2 emissions, with an average of 251.29 units. This suggests that rail travel can be a more environmentally friendly option for business travel, as it emits less CO2 compared to air travel.

However, it is important to note that business travel by rail has higher average CH4 emissions compared to business travel by air. Methane (CH4) is a potent greenhouse gas, and efforts should be made to mitigate its emissions from rail travel.

Additionally, business travel by air has higher average N2O emissions compared to business travel by rail. Nitrous oxide (N2O) is another greenhouse gas that contributes to climate change. Strategies to reduce N2O emissions from air travel should be explored to minimize its environmental impact.

In conclusion, the analysis highlights the need for sustainable practices and alternative transportation options to reduce the environmental impact of business travel. This includes promoting more efficient air travel and exploring low-emission alternatives such as rail travel. By implementing measures to reduce CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions, businesses can contribute to a more sustainable future.
Here is a summary of the CO2 emissions, CH4 emissions, and N2O emissions for business travel air and business travel rail:

Business Travel Air Emissions:
- Average CO2 emissions: 431.0 units
